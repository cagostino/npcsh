## Example 1: Data Analyst NPC - Calculating Sum Using Stats Calculator
```bash
# Switch to the data analyst NPC
/data_analyst

# Load data from a table in the database
load data from sales_table

# Use the stats_calculator tool to calculate the sum of units sold in the East region
use stats calculator to calculate the sum of 'Units_Sold' where 'Region' is 'East'
```
Explanation:

/data_analyst: Switches to the data_analyst NPC, specialized in data analysis tasks.
load data from sales_table: Loads data from sales_table into the NPC's context for analysis.

Stats Calculator Usage: Instructs the NPC to perform a sum operation on the Units_Sold column, filtering for records where the Region is East.

## Example 2: Data Mode - Plotting a Histogram

```bash
# Enter data mode
/data

# Load the sales data using pandas
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Plot a histogram of the 'Units_Sold' column
plt.hist(df['Units_Sold'])

```
Explanation:

/data: Enters the data mode, allowing direct execution of Python data analysis commands.
Loading Data: Uses pandas to read sales_data.csv into a DataFrame named df.
Plotting: Uses matplotlib to plot a histogram of the Units_Sold column.
Displaying the Plot: Ensures the plot is displayed using plt.show().

## Example 3: Foreman NPC - Checking the Weather
```bash


# Switch to the foreman NPC
/foreman

# Ask about the weather in a specific location
What's the weather in Tokyo?
```

Explanation:

/foreman: Switches to the foreman NPC.
Weather Inquiry: The NPC uses the weather_tool to retrieve and display the current weather in Tokyo.

## Example 4: Generating an Image Using the Image Generation Tool

```bash
# Use the image generation tool within any NPC
Generate an image of a serene mountain landscape during sunrise.

# Or explicitly call the tool
Use the image_generation_tool to create an image of a futuristic city skyline at night.
Explanation:

Image Generation: Prompts the NPC to use the image_generation_tool to generate images based on your descriptions.
```


## Example 5: Screen Capture Analysis
```bash
# Invoke the screen capture analysis tool
Take a screenshot and analyze it for any errors or warnings displayed.

# Or with a specific prompt
Capture my current screen and tell me what you see.
```

Explanation:

Screen Capture: The NPC uses the screen_capture_analysis_tool to capture the current screen and provides an analysis based on the captured image.

## Example 6: Calculating with the Calculator Tool
```bash
# Use the calculator tool to compute an expression
Calculate the sum of 15 and 27.

# Or with a more complex expression
What is the result of (52 * 3) + 19?
Explanation:

Calculator Usage: The NPC uses the calculator tool to evaluate mathematical expressions and provides the results.

## Example 7: Executing SQL Queries with SQL Executor

```bash
# Switch to the data analyst NPC
/data_analyst

# Execute an SQL query
sql SELECT Region, SUM(Units_Sold) FROM sales_table GROUP BY Region;
# The NPC executes the query and displays the results
```
Explanation:

SQL Execution: Uses the sql_executor tool to run SQL queries directly against the database and display the results.


## Example 8: Using Notes Mode to Save Reminders
```bash
# Enter notes mode to jot down important information
/notes
# Add a note
Review the Q3 financial report before the meeting next Tuesday.

# Exit notes mode
/nq
```
Explanation:

/notes: Enters notes mode where any input is saved as a note.
Adding a Note: Type the note you want to save.
/nq: Exits notes mode.
## Example 9: Whisper Mode for Voice Interaction

```bash


# Enter whisper mode for speech-to-text interaction
/whisper

# Speak your command after the prompt appears
"Show me the sales trends for the last quarter."

# The NPC processes the spoken command and provides the output
Explanation:

/whisper: Activates whisper mode for voice interaction using speech recognition.
Voice Command: Allows you to speak commands instead of typing them.
```
## Example 10: Using the Data Plotter Tool
```bash


# Switch to the data analyst NPC
/data_analyst

# Load the data
load data from sales_data_table

# Use the data_plotter tool to create a line graph
Use the data_plotter tool to plot a line graph of 'Date' vs. 'Revenue' from 'sales_data_table'
```
Explanation:

Data Plotter Usage: The NPC uses the data_plotter tool to generate a line graph, saving the plot as an image file and displaying it.

## Example 11: Custom NPCs and Tools
```bash

# Assuming you have created a custom NPC named 'marketing_analyst'
/marketing_analyst

# Use a custom tool for sentiment analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on the latest customer feedback dataset.
```
Explanation:

Custom NPC: Switches to a user-defined NPC tailored for specific roles.
Custom Tool: Demonstrates how to use a custom tool within your NPC for specialized tasks.


## Example 12: Data Analysis with Pandas Executor
```bash
# Switch to the data analyst NPC
/data_analyst
# Use the pandas_executor tool to compute statistics
Use the pandas_executor tool with the following code:
code=
"""
mean_units = df['Units_Sold'].mean()
print(f"The average units sold is {mean_units}")
"""
```
Explanation:

Pandas Executor: Executes arbitrary pandas code within the context of the NPC, allowing for customized data analysis.
## Example 13: Combining Tools for Complex Tasks

```bash
# Switch to the data analyst NPC
/data_analyst
# Load data into a DataFrame
load data from employee_performance
# Use the stats_calculator to find the average performance score for a department
use stats calculator to calculate the mean of 'Performance_Score' where 'Department' is 'Sales'
# Then, use the data_plotter to visualize the distribution
Use the data_plotter tool to create a histogram of 'Performance_Score' for the 'Sales' department
```
Explanation:

Combining Tools: Demonstrates how to use multiple tools in sequence to perform advanced analysis.
